/**
 * @file test/fixtures/pipeline-project.ts
 * @description A newsroom project that exercises every lifecycle SHAPE the
 * Pipeline panel has to draw, in one profile.
 *
 * It is the SHIPPED newsroom template's entity types with two edits, not a
 * hand-written copy of them, so the fixture cannot drift from the profile the
 * product actually installs:
 *   - `articles` gains `killed` — a declared state (the lifecycle field's enum
 *     must equal the state set, so it has to appear there) that no transition
 *     reaches from `draft`. That is what the panel draws as unreachable.
 *   - `bylines` loses its order — no terminal state and no edges, so nothing
 *     puts its two states in a sequence and the panel must imply none.
 *   - `desks` is untouched: the plain ordered case.
 *
 * The seeded pages make two collectors disagree on purpose. `articles` and
 * `bylines` each get pages that fail their field contract but still carry a
 * lifecycle value, so the UNFILTERED state tally exceeds the VALID page count by
 * exactly the number of rejected pages — the finding the panel's third column
 * reports.
